# Enterprise Architecture Visibility & Intelligence Platform (EAVIP)

## Overview

Welcome to the official documentation repository for the  
**Enterprise Architecture Visibility & Intelligence Platform (EAVIP)**.

EAVIP is a CAST Highlight–class (and beyond) platform designed to provide
**end-to-end enterprise architecture visibility**, governance, and intelligence
under a single, authoritative system of record.

This repository contains the complete architectural, operational, and governance
definition of the platform.

---

## How to Use This Repository

- All documents are written in Markdown and GitHub-friendly
- Documents are **authoritative**, not illustrative
- Architecture intent is explicitly documented
- Execution follows what is defined here

Start with **Platform Foundations**, then move sequentially.

- Execution-ready

From this point forward:
- Documentation changes are incremental
- Architecture moves to design & implementation
- Execution becomes the primary focus

---

## Next Steps

- UX & interaction design (Figma)
- Service decomposition
- Data schemas
- API contracts
- Source code implementation
