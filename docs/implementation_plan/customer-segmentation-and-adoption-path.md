# Customer Segmentation & Adoption Path

## Purpose

This document defines the authoritative customer segmentation model and
adoption path for the Enterprise Architecture Visibility & Intelligence
Platform (EAVIP).

It ensures that:
- The platform is positioned correctly for different enterprise profiles
- Adoption is progressive, not overwhelming
- Value is realized early and compounds over time
- Go-to-market aligns with architectural maturity

This is the customer value and adoption strategy contract for EAVIP.

## Core Principles (Locked)

1. Adoption follows maturity, not ambition  
2. Value must be visible before intelligence  
3. Architecture trust precedes automation  
4. No customer is forced into an advanced model prematurely  
5. Platform depth scales with organizational readiness
