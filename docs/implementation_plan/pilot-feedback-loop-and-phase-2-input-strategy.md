# Pilot Feedback Loop & Phase-2 Input Strategy

## Purpose

This document defines the authoritative mechanism for capturing, classifying,
and acting upon feedback from Phase-1 pilot enterprises to shape Phase-2 of
the Enterprise Architecture Visibility & Intelligence Platform (EAVIP).

It ensures that:
- Feedback is evidence-based, not anecdotal
- Phase-2 scope is driven by real usage
- No ad-hoc feature creep occurs
- Learning is institutionalized, not lost

This is the learning-to-execution bridge between Phase-1 and Phase-2.

---

## Core Principles (Locked)

1. Pilot feedback is a signal, not an order
2. Evidence outweighs opinion
3. No Phase-2 scope is finalized without pilot data
4. Feedback must map to platform intent
5. Learning must be traceable and reviewable

---

## Feedback Sources

Feedback may originate from:

- Enterprise architects
- Platform architects
- Governance and security teams
- Executives
- Delivery and operations teams

All feedback must be attributable to a role and context.

---

## Feedback Capture Channels

Feedback is captured through:

- Structured pilot review sessions
- Guided walkthroughs
- In-tool feedback linked to graph entities
- Governance workflow observations
- Executive review meetings

Unstructured feedback is normalized before evaluation.

---

## Feedback Classification Model

All feedback is classified into one of the following categories:

- Bug or defect
- Usability or UX issue
- Performance or scalability concern
- Missing Phase-1 capability
- Phase-2 capability candidate
- Out-of-scope request

Classification is mandatory before discussion.

---

## Evidence Requirements

Every feedback item must include at least one of:

- Reproducible scenario
- Screenshot or recording
- Diagram or graph reference
- Governance audit trail
- Measurable impact statement

Feedback without evidence is logged but not prioritized.

---

## Phase-2 Candidate Qualification

A feedback item qualifies as a Phase-2 candidate only if:

- Phase-1 acceptance criteria were met without it
- The issue cannot be solved by configuration or training
- Multiple pilot participants surface the same concern
- The concern aligns with long-term platform intent

Single-customer customizations are rejected.

---

## Feedback Review Cadence

- Weekly internal review during pilot
- End-of-pilot consolidation workshop
- Formal Phase-2 input review session

All reviews are documented and archived.

---

## Decision Outcomes

Each qualified feedback item results in one of:

- Accepted into Phase-2 scope
- Deferred to later phase
- Rejected with documented rationale
- Addressed via non-product means

No feedback remains undecided.

---

## Traceability & Learning

For accepted Phase-2 items:

- Feedback is linked to pilot context
- Original assumptions are recorded
- Expected value is stated
- Success metrics are defined

This enables post-Phase-2 evaluation.

---

## Anti-Patterns Explicitly Prevented

- Feature requests without context
- Loudest-voice prioritization
- Consulting-driven scope inflation
- Premature intelligence features
- Phase-1 rework disguised as Phase-2

---

## Phase-2 Readiness Signal

Phase-2 planning may begin only when:

- Phase-1 acceptance criteria are met
- Pilot feedback is fully classified
- Phase-2 candidates are evidence-backed
- Leadership review is completed

---

## Outcome

With this feedback loop:
- Phase-2 is grounded in reality
- Platform evolution is disciplined
- Learning compounds over time
- Enterprise trust deepens

---

## Status

This document defines the authoritative pilot feedback loop
and Phase-2 input strategy for EAVIP.
