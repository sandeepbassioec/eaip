# Phase 2 Scope Preview & Guardrails

## Purpose

This document provides a controlled, non-binding preview of **Phase 2**
for the Enterprise Architecture Visibility & Intelligence Platform (EAVIP).

Its purpose is to:
- Signal direction without committing scope
- Set guardrails before enthusiasm creates drift
- Align stakeholders on what Phase 2 is and is not
- Prevent premature execution or assumption

This document is **informational**, not an execution contract.

---

## Phase 2 Intent (Context Only)

Phase 2 exists to evolve EAVIP from a **trusted architecture system**
into an **operationally intelligent platform**.

Phase 2 builds on:
- A validated Enterprise Graph
- Proven governance workflows
- Real pilot evidence
- Executive trust established in Phase 1

Phase 2 does not re-litigate Phase 1 decisions.

---

## Phase 2 Capability Themes (Preview)

The following themes are **eligible** for Phase 2 consideration,
subject to pilot evidence and governance approval.

### Architecture Observability

- Observed architecture ingestion
- Runtime signals mapped to intent
- Confidence scoring enrichment
- Drift visibility (not auto-correction)

---

### Architecture Intelligence

- Blast radius simulation
- Dependency risk analysis
- Architecture optionality scoring
- What-if scenario modeling

---

### Governance Maturity

- Policy-as-code expansion
- Soft vs hard violation tuning
- Exception lifecycle management
- Evidence-driven governance decisions

---

### Executive & Strategic Intelligence

- Transformation progress tracking
- Roadmap health indicators
- Risk exposure over time
- Architecture readiness scoring

---

## Explicit Phase 2 Non-Commitments

The following are **not committed** by this document:

- Specific feature lists
- Delivery timelines
- Staffing plans
- Technology changes
- Commercial packaging

All such decisions require Phase-1 completion and pilot evidence.

---

## Guardrails (Non-Negotiable)

Phase 2 must adhere to the following constraints:

1. No Phase-1 rework disguised as Phase-2 features  
2. No automation without explainability  
3. No AI-driven decisions without human approval  
4. No vendor lock-in introduced  
5. No degradation of on-prem parity  
6. No erosion of governance discipline  

Violation of guardrails blocks progression.

---

## Phase Transition Dependency

Phase 2 planning may only begin when:

- Phase-1 acceptance criteria are fully met
- Pilot validation is successful
- Feedback is classified and reviewed
- Leadership gives explicit approval

There is no automatic progression.

---

## Why This Preview Exists

This document exists to:
- Reduce uncertainty
- Prevent misaligned expectations
- Give stakeholders a shared mental model
- Avoid “Phase-2 creep” during Phase-1 execution

It is deliberately conservative.

---

## Outcome

With this preview:
- Stakeholders understand what Phase 2 could become
- Execution remains focused on Phase 1
- Architectural integrity is protected
- Platform evolution stays intentional

---

## Status

This document provides an informational preview of Phase 2 scope and guardrails.
It does not authorize Phase-2 execution.
