# Roadmap & Phased Execution Plan

## Purpose

This document defines the **authoritative phased execution roadmap**
for the Enterprise Architecture Visibility & Intelligence Platform (EAVIP).

It translates the locked vision, principles, and capabilities into:
- Executable phases
- Clear outcomes per phase
- Risk-managed sequencing
- Decision checkpoints

This is the **delivery contract** for product, engineering, and leadership.

---

## Roadmap Principles (Locked)

1. Ship value early without architectural debt
2. Core truth before intelligence
3. Governance before automation
4. Visibility before optimization
5. Extensions only after stability
6. Every phase must stand alone

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation Stabilization (NOW)

Objective:
- Freeze the platform constitution
- Ensure consistency and readiness for execution

Includes:
- State file finalized
- Documentation index finalized
- Core principles and decisions locked
- Scope boundaries clearly defined

Exit Criteria:
- No open foundational decisions
- No conflicting documents
- Clear ownership model

Status:
- Completed

---

## Phase 1 — Core Platform MVP (Execution Baseline)

Objective:
- Deliver a usable, truthful enterprise architecture platform

Includes:
- Enterprise Graph core
- Manual modeling (Enterprise, Org, App, Component)
- Auto-generated C4-style diagrams
- Basic governance workflows
- Document attachment and indexing
- Read-only executive reporting
- SaaS reference deployment

Explicitly Excludes:
- Runtime observability
- Advanced intelligence
- Plugin framework

Primary Users:
- Enterprise Architects
- Platform Architects

Exit Criteria:
- Real enterprise can model its architecture
- Diagrams are trustworthy
- Governance workflows are usable
- No manual diagrams required

---

## Phase 2 — Governance & Intelligence Expansion

Objective:
- Make architecture operationally useful and governable

Includes:
- Advanced governance rules
- Dependency impact analysis
- Policy enforcement with soft violations
- API access and SDKs
- Historical time context
- Portfolio-level reporting

Primary Users:
- Architects
- Security teams
- Platform governance groups

Exit Criteria:
- Architecture changes are controlled
- Impact analysis is reliable
- Executives trust reports

---

## Phase 3 — Observability & Drift Detection

Objective:
- Connect intent with reality

Includes:
- Observed graph ingestion
- Drift detection (structural, security, deployment)
- Drift visualization and governance workflows
- Confidence scoring foundations

Explicitly Excludes:
- Automated intent mutation

Primary Users:
- Operations
- Security
- Architecture governance

Exit Criteria:
- Drift is visible and explainable
- Governance actions are triggered by evidence

---

## Phase 4 — Advanced Architecture Intelligence

Objective:
- Turn architecture into a decision system

Includes:
- Architecture Confidence Scoring (full)
- Blast Radius Simulation
- Architecture Optionality Index
- Decision regret tracking
- What-if scenario modeling

Primary Users:
- Executive leadership
- Transformation programs
- Enterprise strategy teams

Exit Criteria:
- Architecture supports funding and prioritization decisions
- Value realization is measurable

---

## Phase 5 — Ecosystem & Scale

Objective:
- Enable safe extensibility and market expansion

Includes:
- Plugin & extension framework
- Industry-specific policy packs
- Advanced reporting packs
- BYOC and On-Prem hardening
- Anonymous benchmarking (opt-in)

Primary Users:
- Partners
- Large regulated enterprises

Exit Criteria:
- Platform scales across enterprises
- Extensions do not fragment truth

---

## Phase 6 — Optimization & Market Leadership

Objective:
- Establish category leadership

Includes:
- AI-assisted insights (advisory only)
- Proactive recommendations
- Architecture maturity scoring
- Market benchmarking dashboards

Exit Criteria:
- Platform is decision-critical
- Differentiation is undeniable

---

## Decision Gates

Each phase requires:
- Formal review
- Value assessment
- Risk reassessment
- Explicit go / no-go decision

No phase auto-rolls into the next.

---

## What This Roadmap Avoids

- Big-bang delivery
- Over-engineering too early
- Intelligence without trust
- Plugins before stability
- AI before fundamentals

---

## Outcome

With this phased roadmap:
- Execution is controlled
- Risk is managed
- Value compounds
- Architecture remains clean
- The platform can evolve for years

---

## Status

This document defines the **authoritative roadmap and phased execution plan**.
All delivery planning must align with this roadmap.
