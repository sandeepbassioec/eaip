# Phase 2 Planning Trigger & Readiness Checklist

## Purpose

This document defines the **authoritative trigger conditions and readiness checklist**
required before **Phase 2 planning** may formally begin for the
Enterprise Architecture Visibility & Intelligence Platform (EAVIP).

It ensures that:
- Phase 2 is entered intentionally, not emotionally
- Readiness is evidence-based
- Phase boundaries are respected
- Architectural discipline is preserved

This is a **gatekeeping document**, not a roadmap.

---

## Core Principle (Locked)

Phase 2 is a **privilege earned by evidence**, not a natural continuation of Phase 1.

---

## Mandatory Phase 2 Triggers

Phase 2 planning may begin only when **all** of the following triggers are satisfied.

### Trigger 1: Phase 1 Acceptance Completed

Confirmation that:
- All Phase-1 acceptance criteria are met
- All quality gates are passed
- No waivers remain open
- No deferred Phase-1 items exist

Evidence:
- Signed Phase-1 acceptance report
- Quality gate checklist

---

### Trigger 2: Pilot Enterprise Validation Successful

Confirmation that:
- At least one pilot enterprise completed onboarding
- Architecture modeled end-to-end
- Diagrams replaced manual artifacts
- Governance workflows were used in practice
- Executives consumed dashboards

Evidence:
- Pilot validation summary
- Executive sign-off
- Feedback classification report

---

### Trigger 3: Feedback Fully Classified

Confirmation that:
- All pilot feedback is categorized
- Evidence exists for each accepted item
- Out-of-scope requests are explicitly rejected
- No feedback remains undecided

Evidence:
- Feedback register
- Phase-2 candidate shortlist

---

### Trigger 4: Platform Stability Confirmed

Confirmation that:
- No critical production defects remain
- Performance targets are met
- Security baseline is validated
- Operational procedures exist

Evidence:
- Stability report
- Performance benchmarks
- Security review results

---

## Readiness Checklist

All items below must be explicitly marked **Yes** before Phase 2 planning.

### Architecture Readiness

- Enterprise Graph proven stable
- Governance workflows trusted
- Diagram engine performs at scale
- No architectural shortcuts exist

---

### Organizational Readiness

- Clear Phase-2 ownership defined
- Delivery capacity available
- Stakeholders aligned on intent
- No unresolved Phase-1 disputes

---

### Strategic Readiness

- Phase-2 goals articulated at outcome level
- Success metrics defined
- Guardrails reaffirmed
- No assumptions carried forward implicitly

---

## Explicit Anti-Patterns Prevented

This checklist exists to prevent:

- Phase overlap
- Premature intelligence features
- Rebranding Phase-1 gaps as Phase-2 innovation
- Stakeholder-driven scope inflation
- Loss of architectural trust

---

## Decision Output

Successful readiness review results in:

- Formal Phase-2 planning authorization
- Defined Phase-2 planning objectives
- Agreed planning horizon
- Reinforced guardrails

Failure results in:
- Continued Phase-1 stabilization
- Targeted remediation actions
- Re-evaluation at a later date

---

## Outcome

With this trigger and readiness checklist:
- Phase transitions are controlled
- Platform evolution remains intentional
- Leadership confidence is preserved
- Long-term architectural integrity is protected

---

## Status

This document defines the **mandatory trigger conditions and readiness checklist**
for initiating Phase-2 planning for EAVIP.
