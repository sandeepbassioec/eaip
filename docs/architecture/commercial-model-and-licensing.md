# Commercial Model & Licensing

## Purpose

This document defines the **authoritative commercial model and licensing strategy**
for the Enterprise Architecture Visibility & Intelligence Platform (EAVIP).

It explains:
- How the product is packaged and sold
- What capabilities are monetized
- How pricing aligns with enterprise value
- How SaaS, BYOC, and On-Prem are licensed consistently

This is the **commercial contract** for product, sales, finance, and customers.

---

## Core Commercial Principles (Locked)

1. Pricing aligns with enterprise value, not raw usage
2. Architecture intelligence is a strategic capability, not a utility
3. The same capability model applies across SaaS, BYOC, and On-Prem
4. Licensing must not distort architectural truth
5. Commercial complexity must not leak into product design
6. Transparency over surprise billing

---

## Licensing Dimensions (Authoritative)

Licensing is based on **capability tiers**, not infrastructure metrics.

Primary dimensions:
- Number of modeled applications
- Enabled platform capabilities
- Governance and intelligence depth
- Deployment model (SaaS / BYOC / On-Prem)

Infrastructure consumption (CPU, memory, storage) is **never** a pricing axis.

---

## Capability Tiers

### 1. Foundation Tier

Target Customers:
- Small to mid-size enterprises
- Initial architecture visibility initiatives

Includes:
- Enterprise Graph core
- Manual modeling
- Auto-generated diagrams
- Basic drill-down navigation
- Document attachment
- Read-only executive reporting

Excludes:
- Drift detection
- Advanced governance
- Transformation modeling
- Plugin framework

---

### 2. Professional Tier

Target Customers:
- Large enterprises
- Architecture-driven transformation programs

Includes:
- Everything in Foundation
- Governance workflows
- Dependency impact analysis
- API access and SDKs
- Role-based access control
- Historical time context
- Reporting dashboards

Excludes:
- Advanced observability-driven drift detection
- Custom intelligence plugins

---

### 3. Enterprise Tier

Target Customers:
- Regulated industries
- Complex, multi-org enterprises

Includes:
- Everything in Professional
- Observability-based drift detection
- Advanced risk and compliance mapping
- Scenario and what-if modeling
- Plugin and extension framework
- Priority support and SLAs

---

## Deployment Model Licensing

### SaaS

- Subscription-based
- Annual contracts
- Tier-based pricing
- Optional add-ons

### BYOC

- Subscription license
- Customer operates infrastructure
- Reduced operational component
- Same capability tiers

### On-Prem

- Term-based or perpetual license
- Annual maintenance and support
- Capability-tier aligned
- Optional professional services

---

## Add-On Capabilities

Optional add-ons may include:
- Advanced compliance packs
- Industry-specific policies
- Custom reporting packs
- Extended retention
- Dedicated support

Add-ons extend capabilities, not core truth.

---

## User & Role Considerations

- No per-user pricing
- Roles are unlimited within licensed scope
- Read-only access is unrestricted

The product is licensed for **enterprise collaboration**, not seat counting.

---

## Contractual Guardrails

- Clear definition of licensed scope
- Explicit overage handling
- Audit-friendly usage metrics
- Graceful upgrade paths

No dark patterns.

---

## Sales & Expansion Strategy

- Land with Foundation or Professional
- Expand via capability enablement
- Upsell driven by value realization dashboards
- Expansion aligns with maturity, not pressure

---

## What This Model Avoids

- Seat-based pricing traps
- Infrastructure-metered billing
- Feature fragmentation
- Hidden limits
- Complex license enforcement in code

---

## Outcome

With this commercial model:
- Pricing matches enterprise value
- Customers trust the platform
- Sales aligns with architecture maturity
- Growth is sustainable and predictable
- Product design remains clean

---

## Status

This document defines the **authoritative commercial model and licensing strategy**.
All pricing, packaging, and contracts must conform to this model.
