# Value Realization & ROI Modeling

## Purpose

This document defines the **authoritative value realization and ROI modeling framework**
for the Enterprise Architecture Visibility & Intelligence Platform (EAVIP).

It explains:
- How architectural work translates into measurable business value
- How ROI is calculated without vanity metrics
- How evidence is traced back to the Enterprise Graph
- How leaders make funding and prioritization decisions with confidence

This is the **value-intelligence contract** for executives, finance, and architecture.

## Core Value Principles (Locked)

1. Architecture value must be measurable
2. Every value claim must link to evidence
3. Baselines are mandatory
4. Time context is non-optional
5. ROI is directional before it is precise
6. Value realization is continuous, not one-time

---

## Value Dimensions (Authoritative)

### 1. Risk Reduction

Definition:
- Reduction in architectural, security, and compliance risk

Measured By:
- Decrease in critical policy violations
- Reduction in high-risk dependencies
- Fewer trust boundary crossings
- Reduced blast radius in impact analysis

Evidence Sources:
- Policy evaluations
- Dependency graphs
- Security overlays
- Historical snapshots

---

### 2. Cost Avoidance

Definition:
- Costs not incurred due to informed architectural decisions

Measured By:
- Retired duplicate platforms
- Reduced vendor sprawl
- Decommissioned applications
- Infrastructure simplification

Evidence Sources:
- Application lifecycle state
- Technology tagging
- Dependency consolidation metrics

---

### 3. Delivery Acceleration

Definition:
- Faster and more predictable delivery due to reduced complexity

Measured By:
- Reduced dependency depth
- Fewer cross-team handoffs
- Simplified critical paths
- Lower integration coupling

Evidence Sources:
- Dependency graphs
- Impact analysis
- Transformation sequencing data

---

### 4. Resilience Improvement

Definition:
- Increased system stability and failure containment

Measured By:
- Reduced fan-out from critical components
- Improved isolation of failures
- Reduced single points of failure
- Improved redundancy patterns

Evidence Sources:
- Component dependency topology
- Trust boundaries
- Runtime signals (future phase)

---

### 5. Compliance Confidence

Definition:
- Confidence in meeting regulatory and audit requirements

Measured By:
- Coverage of required controls
- Reduction in audit findings
- Faster evidence retrieval
- Improved historical traceability

Evidence Sources:
- Compliance mappings
- Control coverage graphs
- Audit trails
- Time-aware evidence replay

---

## Baseline & Comparison Model

Value realization always compares:
- **Baseline State** (T0)
- **Current State** (Tn)
- **Planned State** (To-Be)

Rules:
- Baselines are immutable once set
- Comparisons are time-context aware
- Assumptions must be explicit

---

## ROI Calculation Model

ROI is expressed as:

ROI = (Value Gained − Cost of Change) / Cost of Change

Where:
- Value Gained is derived from value dimensions
- Cost of Change includes:
  - Engineering effort
  - Migration complexity
  - Operational disruption

ROI ranges are preferred over exact figures in early phases.

---

## Initiative-Centric Value Tracking

Every transformation initiative includes:
- Linked applications and components
- Target outcomes
- Expected value dimensions
- Risk assumptions
- Timeline milestones

Progress is measured continuously against the baseline.

---

## What-If & Scenario Modeling

Executives can simulate:
- Funding vs deferring an initiative
- Alternative sequencing strategies
- Partial modernization paths

Outputs include:
- Risk delta
- Dependency impact delta
- Value realization delta

Scenarios never mutate the live graph.

---

## Evidence Traceability

Every value metric must support drill-down to:
- Affected entities
- Changed dependencies
- Governing policies
- ADRs and decisions
- Supporting documents

No metric exists without traceable evidence.

---

## Reporting & Governance

- Value models are read-only
- Calculation logic is versioned
- Changes require governance approval
- Historical ROI views are immutable

---

## What This Model Avoids

- Vanity ROI claims
- Spreadsheet-based justification
- One-time business cases
- Executive guesswork
- Unverifiable benefits

---

## Outcome

With this value realization model:
- Architecture investments become defensible
- Funding decisions are evidence-based
- ROI evolves with the system
- Leaders trust architecture data
- Strategy aligns with execution

---

## Status

This document defines the **authoritative value realization and ROI modeling framework**.
All value reporting and investment analysis must conform to this model.
