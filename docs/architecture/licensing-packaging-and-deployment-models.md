# Licensing, Packaging & Deployment Models

## Purpose

This document defines the authoritative licensing, packaging, and deployment
models for the Enterprise Architecture Visibility & Intelligence Platform (EAVIP).

It ensures that:
- Commercial models align with architectural realities
- Deployment flexibility does not fragment the platform
- Licensing is understandable and enforceable
- SaaS, BYOC, and On-Prem offerings remain consistent in capability

This is the commercial and delivery contract for EAVIP.

---

## Core Principles (Locked)

1. Licensing follows value, not infrastructure
2. Deployment model does not change architectural truth
3. No feature forks across deployment types
4. Commercial simplicity is preferred
5. Enforcement must be auditable and transparent
6. Customers must understand what they are buying

---

## Deployment Models Supported

EAVIP supports three deployment models:

- SaaS (Vendor-hosted)
- BYOC (Customer cloud, platform-managed)
- On-Prem (Customer-managed)

All three models share:
- The same codebase
- The same architectural capabilities
- The same governance rules

Differences are operational, not functional.

---

## Packaging Units

EAVIP is packaged around the following units:

- Enterprise (top-level tenant)
- Organization
- Application
- Component
- Integration endpoint

Licensing does not depend on technical internals such as databases or nodes.

---

## Licensing Dimensions

Licensing is based on a combination of:

- Number of Applications modeled
- Number of Organizations
- Enabled capability tiers
- Deployment model

No per-user pricing for architects.

---

## Capability Tiers (Illustrative)

### Core Architecture Tier

Includes:
- Enterprise Graph modeling
- Auto-generated diagrams
- Governance workflows
- Document management
- Read-only executive dashboards

This tier corresponds to Phase-1 capabilities.

---

### Intelligence Tier

Includes:
- Impact analysis
- Architecture confidence scoring
- Optionality index
- Advanced reporting

Aligned with Phase-2 and beyond.

---

### Platform Extension Tier

Includes:
- Plugins and extensions
- Industry-specific policy packs
- Advanced integrations

Available only after platform stabilization.

---

## Deployment-Based Considerations

### SaaS

- Subscription-based licensing
- Vendor-managed operations
- Faster onboarding
- Shared infrastructure with tenant isolation

---

### BYOC

- Subscription + deployment surcharge
- Customer cloud ownership
- Platform-managed workloads
- Clear shared responsibility model

---

### On-Prem

- Term-based license
- Customer-managed infrastructure
- Explicit support boundaries
- Optional enterprise support agreement

---

## License Enforcement Model

- License metadata stored centrally
- Enforcement performed at capability boundaries
- Read-only access preserved on expiry
- No silent feature disabling

License violations surface clearly to administrators.

---

## Trial & Pilot Licensing

- Time-bound pilot licenses supported
- Full Phase-1 capabilities enabled
- No artificial feature restriction
- Conversion path clearly defined

Pilots are treated as first-class engagements.

---

## Upgrade & Expansion

- Tier upgrades without redeployment
- Application count expansion supported
- Clear cost transparency
- No forced re-contracting for growth

---

## Anti-Patterns Explicitly Prevented

- Per-diagram pricing
- Per-API-call pricing
- User-based pricing for architects
- Feature fragmentation by deployment
- Hidden licensing constraints

---

## Outcome

With this licensing and packaging model:
- Commercial discussions are simple
- Deployment flexibility is preserved
- Architecture integrity is not compromised
- Customers trust the platform terms

---

## Status

This document defines the authoritative licensing, packaging,
and deployment models for EAVIP.
