# Commercial Model, Licensing & Go-To-Market Strategy

## Purpose

This document defines how **EAVIP** is commercialized without breaking trust,
governance, or long-term adoption.

Goals:
- Align price with **enterprise value**, not feature count
- Support SaaS, BYOC, and On-Prem without chaos
- Enable land-and-expand adoption
- Avoid per-user pricing traps
- Make procurement conversations predictable

---

## Core Principles

1. **Price value, not seats**
2. **Architecture scope drives cost**
3. **Growth should feel natural, not punitive**
4. **Enterprise procurement must be supported**
5. **No feature hostage-taking**
6. **Commercials must reflect deployment reality**

---

## 1. Buyer Personas (Who Pays vs Who Uses)

### 1.1 Economic Buyers
- CIO / CTO
- CISO (security posture)
- CFO (risk & cost avoidance)

### 1.2 Champions
- Enterprise Architects
- Platform Architects
- Security Architects

### 1.3 Daily Users
- Application architects
- Engineers (read-heavy)
- Governance & compliance teams

> **Rule:**  
> Buyers care about **risk, cost, and outcomes** — not diagram features.

---

## 2. Pricing Axis (CRITICAL DESIGN)

### 2.1 What We Do NOT Price On
- Number of users ❌
- API calls ❌
- Diagram count ❌

These create friction and gaming.

---

### 2.2 Primary Pricing Dimensions (Recommended)

| Dimension | Why |
|---------|-----|
| **Enterprise Size** | Correlates with complexity |
| **# Organizations Modeled** | True architecture scope |
| **# Applications Modeled** | Direct value driver |
| **Deployment Model** | Ops responsibility differs |
| **Advanced Capabilities** | Optional intelligence layers |

---

## 3. Editions & Packaging (Clean & Honest)

### 3.1 Editions Overview

| Edition | Target | Purpose |
|------|------|--------|
| **Foundation** | Small / mid enterprises | Visibility & governance |
| **Professional** | Large enterprises | Intelligence & drift |
| **Enterprise** | Regulated / global | Full control & scale |

---

### 3.2 Capability Matrix (Illustrative)

| Capability | Foundation | Professional | Enterprise |
|----------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Enterprise Graph | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Auto Diagrams | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Governance Rules | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ | ✅ |
| Drift Detection | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Observability Overlay | ❌ | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ |
| Transformation Simulation | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Executive Dashboards | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ | ✅ |
| BYOC | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| On-Prem | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

⚠️ = capped or limited scope

## 4. Deployment-Based Commercials

### 4.1 SaaS
- Subscription-based
- Annual contracts
- Platform-operated

### 4.2 BYOC
- Subscription + support
- Customer infra cost
- Higher trust, higher deal size

### 4.3 On-Prem
- License + annual maintenance
- Support tiers
- Longer sales cycle

> **Rule:**  
> Deployment complexity must be reflected in pricing — transparently.

---

## 5. Add-On Modules (Optional Upsell, Not Lock-In)

Examples:
- Advanced observability intelligence
- Compliance packs (industry-specific)
- Executive reporting packs
- AI-assisted insights (where allowed)

Add-ons:
- Never break core workflows
- Never hold data hostage
- Can be enabled/disabled cleanly

---

## 6. Land-and-Expand Strategy (VERY IMPORTANT)

### 6.1 Land
- Start with 1 org / domain
- Import a small app set
- Deliver immediate visibility

### 6.2 Expand
- More orgs
- More apps
- Advanced governance
- Executive reporting

Expansion follows **natural architecture growth**, not sales pressure.

---

## 7. Sales Motion (Enterprise-Realistic)

### 7.1 Entry Motions
- Architecture visibility gap
- Audit / compliance pressure
- Cloud modernization initiative
- M&A complexity

### 7.2 Proof of Value (PoV)
- 30–60 day PoV
- Real data
- Measurable insights
- Exec-level readout

---

## 8. Procurement & Legal Alignment

- Clear data ownership (customer owns graph)
- BYOC/on-prem security assurances
- Export & exit guarantees
- No dark patterns

Trust reduces sales friction.

---

## 9. Metrics That Matter (Internal)

- Time to first value
- Expansion rate (apps/orgs)
- Renewal rate
- Exec dashboard usage
- Reduction in critical risks (reported)

---

## 10. What This Avoids

- Seat-based pricing wars
- Feature gating core value
- Confusing SKUs
- Punishing success
- Shadow usage

---

## Outcome

With this model:
- Buyers understand value
- Champions succeed internally
- Growth aligns with architecture reality
- Sales cycles shorten
- Long-term trust is built

---

## Status

This document defines the **authoritative commercial and go-to-market model**.

All pricing, packaging, and sales motions **must conform** to this design.
