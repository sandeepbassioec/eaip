# Operating Model & Roles
## Enterprise Architecture Visibility & Intelligence Platform (EAVIP)

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **Operating Model** for EAVIP.
It answers the question:

> “Who does what, who decides what, and how work flows across roles?”

The intent is to:
- Prevent role confusion
- Avoid governance bottlenecks
- Enable scale without chaos
- Clearly separate **decision authority** from **execution responsibility**

> Architecture fails more often due to unclear ownership  
> than due to bad technology choices.

---

## Operating Model Principles

1. Architecture ownership is explicit
2. Decisions have accountable owners
3. Automation assists, humans approve
4. Separation of duties is intentional
5. Visibility precedes control

These principles guide role definitions.

---

## Role Categories Overview

EAVIP operating model defines **four role layers**:

1. Strategic Roles
2. Architectural Roles
3. Execution Roles
4. Consumption Roles

Each layer has different authority levels.

---

## 1. Strategic Roles

### Role: Executive Sponsor (CXO / Business Owner)

**Primary Responsibility**
- Define strategic intent
- Approve major architecture direction
- Allocate budget

**What This Role Can Do**
- View enterprise-wide architecture
- Review risk, cost, and dependency insights
- Approve or reject major transformation initiatives

**What This Role Cannot Do**
- Modify architecture data
- Bypass governance workflows

**Why This Role Exists**
Architecture without executive ownership becomes advisory only
and fails to drive real change.

---

## 2. Architectural Roles

### Role: Enterprise Architect

**Primary Responsibility**
- Own enterprise-wide architectural integrity
- Define standards, principles, and constraints
- Resolve cross-domain conflicts

**What This Role Can Do**
- Create and update enterprise architecture models
- Define governance rules
- Approve or reject architectural decisions

**What This Role Cannot Do**
- Override platform constraints
- Bypass audit trails

**Why This Role Exists**
Someone must own the *whole picture* beyond individual projects.

---

### Role: Solution Architect

**Primary Responsibility**
- Design application-level architectures
- Ensure alignment with enterprise standards

**What This Role Can Do**
- Model applications and components
- Define application-level data flows
- Propose architectural decisions

**What This Role Cannot Do**
- Modify enterprise-wide principles
- Bypass governance approvals

**Why This Role Exists**
Bridges enterprise intent with project-level execution.

---

## 3. Execution Roles

### Role: Platform Administrator

**Primary Responsibility**
- Operate and maintain the EAVIP platform

**What This Role Can Do**
- Configure platform settings
- Manage onboarding
- Maintain integrations and infrastructure

**What This Role Cannot Do**
- Change architecture facts
- Make business decisions

**Why This Role Exists**
Separates operational responsibility from architectural authority.

---

### Role: Integration Engineer

**Primary Responsibility**
- Integrate EAVIP with external systems

**What This Role Can Do**
- Configure connectors and adapters
- Manage secure connectivity profiles
- Monitor ingestion pipelines

**What This Role Cannot Do**
- Change core architecture models
- Override domain rules

**Why This Role Exists**
Integration requires specialized skills and controlled access.

---

## 4. Consumption Roles

### Role: Developer / Engineer

**Primary Responsibility**
- Consume architecture information
- Align implementation with defined architecture

**What This Role Can Do**
- View application architecture
- Inspect dependencies and data flows
- Reference ADRs and standards

**What This Role Cannot Do**
- Modify architecture without approval

**Why This Role Exists**
Developers need clarity, not control.

---

### Role: Auditor / Compliance Officer

**Primary Responsibility**
- Validate compliance and traceability

**What This Role Can Do**
- Review architecture history
- Access audit trails
- Verify compliance mappings

**What This Role Cannot Do**
- Modify any architecture data

**Why This Role Exists**
Compliance requires independence and immutability.

## Authority Matrix (Summary)

| Role | View | Propose | Modify | Approve |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| Executive Sponsor | ✔ | ✖ | ✖ | ✔ |
| Enterprise Architect | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| Solution Architect | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✖ |
| Platform Admin | ✔ | ✖ | ✖ | ✖ |
| Integration Engineer | ✔ | ✖ | ✖ | ✖ |
| Developer | ✔ | ✖ | ✖ | ✖ |
| Auditor | ✔ | ✖ | ✖ | ✖ |

---

## Governance Flow (High-Level)

1. Change proposed by Solution Architect
2. Impact analysis generated by EAVIP
3. Review by Enterprise Architect
4. Approval (if required) by Executive Sponsor
5. Decision recorded as ADR
6. Architecture updated
7. Downstream systems notified

---

## Why This Operating Model Was Chosen

### Alternatives Considered

**Option A: Everyone can edit**
- Fast initially
- Leads to chaos and mistrust

**Option B: Centralized gatekeeper**
- Strong control
- Becomes bottleneck

**Option C: Layered authority model (Chosen)**

### Reasoning
Layered authority balances:
- Speed
- Accountability
- Scalability
- Governance

---

## Trade-offs

**Pros**
- Clear ownership
- Reduced conflicts
- Audit-ready

**Cons**
- Requires discipline
- Initial cultural adjustment

---

## Closing Notes

This operating model is intentionally conservative.
It favors:
- Long-term trust
- Clear accountability
- Sustainable evolution

Architecture is a **team sport**,  
but teams need **clear rules of engagement**.
