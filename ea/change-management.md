# Architecture Change Management & Continuous Evolution
## Enterprise Architecture Visibility & Intelligence Platform (EAVIP)

---

## Purpose

This document represents **TOGAF Phase H – Architecture Change Management**.

It defines how EAVIP:
- Evolves safely over time
- Responds to internal and external change
- Prevents architecture decay
- Maintains relevance for years (not releases)

It answers:
- How do we handle change without breaking trust?
- How do we detect when architecture must change?
- How do we distinguish healthy evolution from drift?

> Architecture is not a project.  
> Architecture is a **living system**.

---

## Why Phase H Is Critical

Most organizations:
- Design architecture once
- Implement partially
- Never revisit it

The result:
- Architecture rot
- Shadow systems
- Unplanned dependencies
- Reactive decision-making

Phase H exists to **close the loop** and ensure sustainability.

---

## Core Change Management Principles (Locked)

1. Change is inevitable
2. Unmanaged change equals drift
3. Drift must be detected, not guessed
4. All change must be explainable
5. Architecture evolves deliberately, not accidentally

---

## Types of Architectural Change

EAVIP recognizes **four categories of change**:

### 1. Business-Driven Change
- New regulations
- Mergers & acquisitions
- New products or markets

### 2. Technology-Driven Change
- End-of-life platforms
- New standards
- Security vulnerabilities

### 3. Operational Change
- Scaling needs
- Cost pressures
- Reliability improvements

### 4. Emergent Change
- Observed runtime behavior
- Drift from intended design
- Shadow integrations

Each category is handled differently.

---

## Change Triggers

Change may be triggered by:
- New requirements
- Architecture metrics thresholds
- Drift detection alerts
- Compliance violations
- Executive decisions

Triggers are **signals**, not automatic actions.

---

## Change Detection Mechanisms

### Manual Detection
- Architect review
- Governance meetings
- Strategic planning cycles

### Automated Detection
- Drift detection from observability
- Dependency graph changes
- Risk score escalation
- Policy violations

Automation informs, humans decide.

---

## Change Evaluation Process

Every change goes through **structured evaluation**:

1. Identify trigger
2. Assess impact
3. Evaluate alternatives
4. Decide action
5. Record rationale
6. Execute change
7. Monitor outcome

Skipping steps is explicitly forbidden.

---

## Change Outcomes

Possible outcomes include:
- Accept and implement change
- Defer change
- Reject change
- Accept with constraints
- Accept as temporary exception

All outcomes are recorded.

---

## Architecture Lifecycle Integration

Phase H feeds directly back into:
- Phase A (Vision) when strategic intent changes
- Phase B (Business Architecture) when business models evolve
- Phase C/D when system structure must adapt

This creates a **closed feedback loop**.

---

## Drift vs Evolution (Critical Distinction)

### Drift
- Unplanned
- Undocumented
- Often invisible
- High long-term risk

### Evolution
- Intentional
- Approved
- Documented
- Strategically aligned

EAVIP’s primary job in Phase H is to **convert drift into evolution**.

---

## Governance in Phase H

Governance ensures:
- Changes do not bypass intent
- Exceptions are visible
- Temporary deviations do not become permanent

Governance intensity scales with:
- Risk
- Impact
- Regulatory exposure

---

## Metrics for Healthy Evolution

Indicators include:
- Time between drift detection and resolution
- Percentage of architecture with current documentation
- Reduction in emergency changes
- Alignment between observed and intended architecture

---

## Trade-offs

**Pros**
- Long-term architectural health
- Reduced surprise failures
- Sustained trust in architecture

**Cons**
- Ongoing investment required
- Requires cultural maturity
- Demands discipline over time

---

## Why This Change Model Works

- Aligns with real enterprise dynamics
- Avoids rigid architecture freezes
- Encourages learning and adaptation
- Preserves historical context

---

## EAVIP as a Living Case Study

EAVIP itself must:
- Follow Phase H
- Record its own evolution
- Detect its own drift
- Serve as a reference implementation

This is non-negotiable.

---

## Closing Notes

Architecture that does not change becomes irrelevant.  
Architecture that changes without control becomes dangerous.

Phase H ensures EAVIP remains:
- Relevant
- Trusted
- Governed
- Valuable

---

## TOGAF Lifecycle Complete

With Phase H, EAVIP now fully supports:
- Continuous architecture design
- Continuous execution alignment
- Continuous evolution

The TOGAF cycle is **closed and repeatable**.
